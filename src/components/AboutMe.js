			<hr />
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Adrian! I'm an aspiring software developer also
				interested in project/program management. I'm particularly
				into game design and development and would love to get to
				work on a game like Beyond Good & Evil or Fire Emblem one day.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, you can find me listening to 90s R&B throwbacks,
				learning a new song on the kalimba, playing (and failing at)
				Fire Emblem, or rewatching Parks and Rec/The Office for the
				<del>3rd</del> <del>4th</del> 5th time!
			</p>
